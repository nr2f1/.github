# NR2F1 Foundation

We are a non-profit organization dedicated to those living with rare variants on the Nr2f1 gene.

These variants cause a neurodevelopmental disorder called [Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosch%E2%80%93Boonstra%E2%80%93Schaaf_optic_atrophy_syndrome) (BBSOAS).
